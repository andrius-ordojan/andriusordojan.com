        This is my blog, I made this site to have a place to put random
        writings. The resource page has a list of things I run for public use
        and a list of alternative software to help you have more control of your
        data and rely less on large corps. I hope it's helpful.

        space for it. i got alot from others sharing hteir learning and knowlage
        and wanted to do the same. maybe some today i learned style writings
        These days I'm working as a site reliability engineer.
