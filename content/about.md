### Who am I?

Hi there! Right now I’m a site reliability engineer by trade and I enjoy trying new things.

I came to Denmark to study computer science and to continue my dream of being a professional MMA fighter. Software development has funded the fighting journey. The first job was a lot of sysadmin work and making CI/CD pipelines. This was back in 2012. I think DevOps was starting to become a buzzword back then. And while the journey of a professional fighting has ended, the software development work is still continuing. While following the CI/CD, DevOps path, I added extra tools and methods along the way. Configuration and infrastructure management, different cloud platforms, containerization. Now I work as a site reliability engineer at Templafy.

I wanted a website where I could share some of the explorations and discoveries I make while learning and working. Because of my professional role, much of my time revolves around Kubernetes and Azure, but I find that my interests weary quite often, so eventually I’ll probably include some things from other parts of my life. 

In my free time, I geek out on a wide breath of hobbies. More recently it’s photography, but not that long ago I had set up a mushroom farm at home. Physical training and combat sports is a daily practice. Also, I have a pretty cute little home server as well for some self-hosted awesomeness. Oh, and I had an obsession with learning to dance salsa for a few years. 

My inbox is always open. Whether you have a question or just want to say hi, I’ll try my best to get back to you! <a href="mailto:andrius.or@gmail.com">**andrius.or\@gmail.com**</a>
