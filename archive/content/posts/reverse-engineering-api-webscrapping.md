Rcently I needed to get a whold of some information on a public website, but unfortunetly the propriator of this website did not have a public API that I could use. 

I written some simple web scrappers before using the python [Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library. So first I attempted to do the same, but didn't receive anything back from the server. I guess this makes sense in the javascript world we live in these days.
